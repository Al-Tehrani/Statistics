    "In inferential statistics, the mean plays a crucial role due to its mathematical properties and its relationship to the normal distribution. Many statistical tests and confidence intervals are based on the sample mean, making it a fundamental concept in statistical inference. The Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, further reinforces the importance of the mean in inferential statistics."
